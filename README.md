# SUMalyzer

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/SangeetM/SUMalyzer.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/SangeetM/SUMalyzer)

### What is it for?

SUMalyzer is a tool to collect, manage and analyze medical data. The goal is to gain insights by observing long term patterns revealed by your personal data. I started this app to monitoring the development of some medical metrics regarding to asthma and allergies, but SUMalyzer is suitable to capture any metric since it is basically tracking text snippets associated to a patient and a location.

You can manage multiple patients, i.e. if you take care of your kids, pets or whatever.
I plan a printing logic to serve the data to your doctors for better therapy support.

A secondary goal is to provide a secure open source platform that can collect anonymized medical data relevant for medical research. If other people, i.e. you, adopt it, it could be the starting point of a solid anonymized database for open access medical research ðŸ”¬.

### Ehm. There are a plenty of shiny mobile phone applications that outperform your CSS skills!

Yes, but they are all not what I really demand. I wanted a transparent open source solution that isn't tied to any company. I did not found any application that _really_ attracted me, so I started writing this one for my own purposes.

### Aha. You only want my data!

Yes, this is about your data. but we don't want you. Currently the minimum to reveal is an
email address for password reset reasons. What we are interested in is medically relevant data like age, sex, height and weight. Also, of course it would be relevant if you relate your input data to places since the flora and fauna around you might influence your medical situation even if you are not 100% aware of.

If you feel uncomfortable with revealing locational or other type of data it is fine. You don't have to put in any input you are uncomfortable with and if you put it in you always will be in control.

### This looks like an interesting project. Can I contribute?

Of course, this would be great! Feel free to clone, modify, submit PRs, open issues or contact me via [twitter](https://www.twitter.com/SangeetMD) or whatever
